    Draw a rounded rectangle on the specified surface with the given rect.

    When the radius is set to a non-positive value, then the function draws a fully rounded rectangle, a.k.a. a stadium.

    A stadium is drawn by a rectangle and 2 antialiased circles. If the radius (r) is specified, the rounded rectangle
    is drawn using two stadiums and an additional horizontal rectangle.

    If the border thickness (b) is more than zero, the rounded rectangle would be drawn in two parts: the outer part
    (for the border) and the inner part (for the fill).

    :param surface: The Pygame surface to draw on
    :param rect: The rect that determines the position and dimensions rounded rectangle.

    :param color: The fill color of the button.
    :param b_color: The border color.

    :param b: The border thickness. If set to 0 then the border is not drawn.
    :param r: The corner radius of the rounded rectangle. If set to a non-positive value, then the function draws a
    fully rounded rectangle / stadium.
